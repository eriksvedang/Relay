Relay is a simple database implemented in C# by Erik Svedäng and Johannes Gotlén.

We use it as the underlying technology for several parts of the game we're building. It enables easy saving and loading of the complete state of systems like entity management, story, etc.

The project should work in both Visual Studio and Mono Develop. The unit tests are written for NUnit.
